## Overview

This is my (third) attempt at recreating Darklooks for GTK3, based on Clearlooks-Phénix.

Currently it's not even on par with a version I made for GTK+ 3.14, but works on 3.22 and is perfectly usable, just ugly/inconsistent.

## Installation

- Clone the repo / download zip

- Copy the directory Darklooks in one of the following two locations:

	- `~/.themes/` for the current user;
	
	- `/usr/share/themes/` for all users, including style for programs ran with root privileges (e.g. Synaptic).

## Development and license

GTK2 portion is actual copy of Darklooks (no idea what version).

GTK3 portion (main attraction) is a fork of [Clearlooks-Phénix](https://github.com/jpfleury/clearlooks-phenix). Original copyright below:
